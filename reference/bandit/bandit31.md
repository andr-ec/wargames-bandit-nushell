Level Goal
----------
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit30-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit30-git/repo` via the port `2220`. The password for the user `bandit30-git` is the same as for the user `bandit30`.

From your local machine (not the OverTheWire machine!),
clone the repository and find the password for the next level.
This needs git installed locally on your machine.
