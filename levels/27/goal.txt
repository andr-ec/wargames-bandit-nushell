There is a git repository at ssh://bandit27-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit27-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit27-git is the same as for the user bandit27.

From your local machine (not the OverTheWire machine!),
clone the repository and find the password for the next level.
This needs git installed locally on your machine.
