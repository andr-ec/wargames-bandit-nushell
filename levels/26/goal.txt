Level Goal
----------
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

(The shell for user bandit26 is not **/bin/bash**, but something else.
You already figured out how to break out of it.)

Nushell commands you may need to solve this level
-------------------------------------------------
[ls](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/docs/ls.html),
[open](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/docs/open.html)

You can also use external commands like `ssh`, `cat`, `more`, `vi`.

NOTE: if you're a Windows user and typically use Powershell to
ssh into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the
intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt
instead.
